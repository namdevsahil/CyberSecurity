<h1>What Is Cybersecurity?</h1>
<main>
    <section class="leftSection">
            <p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and digital information from theft, damage, unauthorized access, and other cyber threats. It involves implementing a combination of technologies, processes, and practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
                The technique of protecting internet-connected systems such as computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks is known as cybersecurity. We can divide cybersecurity into two parts one is cyber, and the other is security. Cyber refers to the technology that includes systems, networks, programs, and data. And security is concerned with the protection of systems, networks, applications, and information. In some cases, it is also called electronic information security or information technology security.

<h1>Types of Cyber Security</h1>

<main>
    <section class="leftSection"> 
        <p><h2>Network security</h2> Network security Application security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="leftSection"> 
        <p><h2>Application security</h2> Application security describes security measures at the application level that aim to prevent data or code within the app from being stolen or hijacked. It encompasses the security considerations that happen during application development and design, but it also involves systems and approaches to protect apps after they get deployed. 
    
        Application security may include hardware, software, and procedures that identify or minimize security vulnerabilities. A router that prevents anyone from viewing a computer’s IP address from the Internet is a form of hardware application security. But security measures at the application level are also typically built into the software, such as an application firewall that strictly defines what activities are allowed and prohibited. Procedures can entail things like an application security routine that includes protocols such as regular testing. </p>

    <section class="leftSection">
            <p><h2>Cloud security</h2> Cloud security is a collection of procedures and technology designed to address external and internal threats to business security. Organizations need cloud security as they move toward their digital transformation strategy and incorporate cloud-based tools and services as part of their infrastructure.
            The terms digital transformation and cloud migration have been used regularly in enterprise settings over recent years. While both phrases can mean different things to different organizations, each is driven by a common denominator: the need for change.
            As enterprises embrace these concepts and move toward optimizing their operational approach, new challenges arise when balancing productivity levels and security. While more modern technologies help organizations advance capabilities outside the confines of on-premise infrastructure, transitioning primarily to cloud-based environments can haveseveral implications if not done securely.</p>

    </section>
    <section class="leftSection">
        <p><h2>Critical infrastructure security</h2>Critical infrastructure security is the area of concern surrounding the protection of systems, networks and assets whose continuous operation is deemed necessary to ensure the security of a given nation, its economy, and the public’s health and/or safety.However, such systems pose a number of security issues.  For one thing, the fact that they are considered critical means that it is difficult to take them down for updates. Their limited computing resources may make it impossible to run antimalware. Furthermore, over 80 percent of such systems are owned and controlled by the private sector, which complicates any government efforts toward their security.</p>

    <section class="leftSection">
        <p><h2>Internet of Things (IoT) Security</h2>IoT security (internet of things security) is the technology segment focused on safeguarding connected devices and networks in IoT. IoT involves adding internet connectivity to a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals and people. Each thing has a unique identifier and the ability to automatically transfer data over a network. However, enabling devices to connect to the internet opens them up to serious vulnerabilities if they aren't properly protected.

            The term IoT is extremely broad, and as this technology continues to evolve, the term only becomes broader. From watches to thermostats to video game consoles, nearly every technological device can interact with the internet, or other devices, in some capacity.
            
            IoT security is even broader than IoT, resulting in a variety of methodologies falling under that umbrella. Application programming interface (API) security, public key infrastructure (PKI) authentication and network security are just a few of the methods IT can use to combat the growing threat of cybercrime and cyberterrorism rooted in vulnerable IoT devices</p>

<h1>What is good cyber security?</h1>

<main>
    <section>        
        Good cybersecurity involves a combination of practices, technologies, policies, and behaviors that work together to protect digital systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. Here are key elements of good cybersecurity:
        
        <h2>Risk Assessment and Management:</h2><p>Identify and assess potential risks and vulnerabilities to your systems and data. This involves understanding the value of assets, evaluating possible threats, and implementing measures to mitigate risks.</p>
        
        <h2>Strong Access Controls:</h2><p>Implement robust access controls to ensure that only authorized individuals or systems can access sensitive data and resources. This includes the use of strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, and regular review and updating of access permissions.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Regular Software Updates and Patch Management:</h2><p>Keep all software, including operating systems, antivirus programs, and applications, up-to-date with the latest security patches. Regularly applying updates helps close known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber attackers.</p>
        
        <h2>Security Awareness and Training:</h2><p>Educate employees and users about cybersecurity best practices. This includes training on recognizing phishing attempts, using strong passwords, and understanding the potential risks associated with various online activities. Awareness programs contribute to building a security-conscious culture within an organization.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Data Encryption:</h2><p>Encrypt sensitive data, both in transit and at rest. Encryption helps protect information from unauthorized access or interception by ensuring that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable without the proper decryption key.</p>
        
        <h2>Network Security:</h2><p>Implement firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and other network security measures to monitor and control traffic. Network security helps prevent unauthorized access and protects against various cyber threats.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Incident Response Plan:</h2><p>Develop and regularly update an incident response plan that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of a cybersecurity incident. A well-prepared response can minimize damage and downtime.</p>
        <h2>Regular Security Audits and Testing:</h2><p>Conduct regular security audits and testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in systems and applications. This may include penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and other proactive measures to ensure ongoing security.</p>
        
        <h2>Collaboration and Information Sharing:</h2><p>Engage with the cybersecurity community and share information about emerging threats and best practices. Collaboration can enhance collective knowledge and help organizations stay informed about the latest risks.</p>
        
        <h2>Compliance with Standards and Regulations:</h2><p>Adhere to industry-specific security standards and regulatory requirements. Compliance with established standards helps ensure a baseline level of security and demonstrates a commitment to protecting sensitive information.</p>
